**What is an LLM? **
An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a type of neural network specifically
designed to process and generate human-like text. These models are built on
massive datasets, intricate architectures, and intensive training processes.
Here’s a simple formula to understand LLMs:
LLM = DATA + ARCHITECTURE + TRAINING

**Data **
LLMs are trained on petabytes of data. To give you an idea:
1 GB can contain around 178 million words.
1 PB (petabyte) equals 1 million GBS

This immense amount of data comes from various sources:
Books
Transcripts
Web scraping

**Architecture **
The architecture of LLMs, like GPT-4, is typically based on transformers.
Transformers are a type of model architecture that significantly advanced
the field by reducing training time and improving performance.
**Training**
Training involves feeding the data into the architecture and adjusting the
model based on its performance in predicting and generating text.
**How Does an LLM Work? **
At its core, an LLM is a neural network trained on vast amounts of data to
recognize patterns in text. Here’s a breakdown of its key components:

1. **Tokenization:**
2. The text is broken down into individual tokens. Tokens can
be single words or parts of words. For example:
Single token: “Hello”
Multi-token: “Summarization” -> “sum”, “mar”, “ization”
2.** Embedding:**
   These tokens are then converted into vectors (1D
representations). This step helps the model understand the context and
relationships between words.
4. **Transformers:** Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms, transformers
process these embeddings to predict and generate text. Transformers use
metrics like perplexity to measure how well the model predicts the next
word in a sequence.
Applications of LLMs
**LLMs are incredibly versatile and can be used for:**
**Summarization:** Condensing long texts into shorter summaries.
**Text Generation: **Creating coherent and contextually relevant text.
**Creative Writing:** Assisting in generating stories, poems, and more.
**Q&A: **Providing answers to questions based on the data they were trained
on.
**Programming:** Helping with code






→ When AI gives wrong or made-up answers 
→ Can be fixed with fact-checking and better prompts
